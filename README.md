# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code-Challenge
## Day 1
I read my first research paper, it was a paper written by Andrew Ng and Michael Jordan in 2002, it talked about the difference between discriminative and generative classifiers, it specifically compared between Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. It was really hard for me to understand, but it felt good trying to.
## Day 2
Today, I started learning about Machine learning theory, it requires so many knowledge and background, it needs someone who understands algorithms, information theory, and a great deal of math, I was afraid of it at first, but I took my time to understand a few things and it went well. I learned about sample complexity, which was a little hard to grasp but it explains important things regarding machine learning in general, which helped me look at the bigger picture for a while.
## Day 3
Today, I started learning about NLP. I joined the Deeplearning.ai specialization of NLP, it seemed easy to understand. I also opened a tutorial provided by Freecodecamp and edureka to start learning about basic NLP concepts such as Lemmetization and Stemming.
## Day 4
Today, I followed along a tutorial that build an RNN LSTM model to predict Gamestop stock prices, it seemed cool, I installed tensorflow for the first time. I also found out about this cool AI auto completion plugin that works on jupyter lab and python, it's called kite. I read a little bit of the book "Hands-on Machine Learning using Scikit learn, Keras, and tensorflow, it's amazing that I understand things, since I was nervous about reading my first technical book.
## Day 5
I tried to use a DL model to automate a car to drive itself.
## Day 6
Reading my ML book, reached Chapter 2 now
## Day 7
I moved forward in an NLP course which is part of the NLP specialization offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera
## Day 8 
Finished weeks 2 and 3 in the NLP course
## Day 9
I was accepted in a program called FWD Egypt which is a mix of data visualization and other data-related topics
## Day 10
I read a little in hand on ML, still in chapter 2 though
## Day 11
Still in chapter 2 and I feel like a turtle! I'm happy I'm learning though.
## Day 12
Finished chapter 2 and started chapter 3 (almost finished!)
## Day 13 
Worked on my upcoming [data analysis project](https://github.com/salma77/Investigating-data-from-TMDb)! I don't like it so much when I'm analyzing data and visualizing it without this being a step to prepare the data for a machine learning model later on. Data science is great and all but without machine learning it's not fun for me.
## Day 14
Worked on my data analysis project! I reached the questions I want to answer and I'm on it!!
## Day 15
Still working on my project but I'm a little bored :P I devised a strategy to analyze my data, I decided to divide my analyses into Movie analysis, Genres analysis, Budget & Revenues analysis, and Directors & Production Companies analysis.
## Day 16
Started chapter 4 in the book
## Day 17
Again worked on my data analysis mini but never ending project
## Day 18
Finished the data analysis project, I need to wrap up the report and submit it quickly before the deadline!
## Day 19
Started my lessons on my data analysis advanced nano degree on Udacity, it was about descriptive statistics, looks fun! However, final exams are coming up so I'm dragging myself to work on something beside studying
## Day 20
Worked on finalizing my project, watched a couple of videos on Udacity classroom
## Day 21
I wrapped up my project and sumbitted it! I also spend a lot of time on Udacity classroom, I learned more about descriptive statistics, all were not new to me but it felt good to recap and connect all the knowledge in one place, the instructor Josh Bernhard is great! He emphasizes the information in a non shallow way that I like.

## Day 22
Read [this cool article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/function-optimization-with-scipy/?__s=fvcxrqrofzeg7arqwfjy)! I also read a few pages in chapter 4 in hands-on, I read about gradient descent and I searched more on function optimizations.

## Day 23
I updated my Udacity project for resubmission! I also found a new data science book and read through the first pages of it, I really liked it, however I'll refrain from beginning in it as I want to finish hands-on efficiently first. I also watched a few videos in my advanced data analysis nano degree.

## Day 24
I read some time in chapter 4 in hands on. I had an online session for my Udacity nano degree, inwhich I worked with a team to analyze the titanic dataset. I also spend some time reading my project review! I got a great review, it was so dense and detailed that I wanted to edit the project further more.
