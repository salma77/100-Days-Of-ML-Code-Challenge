# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code-Challenge
## Day 1
I read my first research paper, it was a paper written by Andrew Ng and Michael Jordan in 2002, it talked about the difference between discriminative and generative classifiers, it specifically compared between Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. It was really hard for me to understand, but it felt good trying to.
## Day 2
Today, I started learning about Machine learning theory, it requires so many knowledge and background, it needs someone who understands algorithms, information theory, and a great deal of math, I was afraid of it at first, but I took my time to understand a few things and it went well. I learned about sample complexity, which was a little hard to grasp but it explains important things regarding machine learning in general, which helped me look at the bigger picture for a while.
## Day 3
Today, I started learning about NLP. I joined the Deeplearning.ai specialization of NLP, it seemed easy to understand. I also opened a tutorial provided by Freecodecamp and edureka to start learning about basic NLP concepts such as Lemmetization and Stemming.
## Day 4
Today, I followed along a tutorial that build an RNN LSTM model to predict Gamestop stock prices, it seemed cool, I installed tensorflow for the first time. I also found out about this cool AI auto completion plugin that works on jupyter lab and python, it's called kite. I read a little bit of the book "Hands-on Machine Learning using Scikit learn, Keras, and tensorflow, it's amazing that I understand things, since I was nervous about reading my first technical book.
## Day 5
I tried to use a DL model to automate a car to drive itself.
## Day 6
Reading my ML book, reached Chapter 2 now
## Day 7
I moved forward in an NLP course which is part of the NLP specialization offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera
## Day 8 
Finished weeks 2 and 3 in the NLP course
## Day 9
I was accepted in a program called FWD Egypt which is a mix of data visualization and other data-related topics
## Day 10
I read a little in hand on ML, still in chapter 2 though
## Day 11
Still in chapter 2 and I feel like a turtle! I'm happy I'm learning though.
## Day 12
Finished chapter 2 and started chapter 3 (almost finished!)
## Day 13 
Worked on my upcoming data analysis project! I don't like it so much when I'm analyzing data and visualizing it without this being a step to prepare the data for a machine learning model later on. Data science is great and all but without machine learning it's not fun for me.
